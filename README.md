Create a menu driven program to interact with a database of Spokane weather records

Start the program, type in a number, and then interact with the console driven program and check out a weather app.

NOTE: The app will crash if you input any letters, there is no loop to prevent that. Pretty easy fix. The menu doesnt show up until you input a number, also a pretty easy fix.
